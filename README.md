# Lego Collector (Front-end)

## Description

Collecting Legos is a hobby of mine - and I know many others do the same. I buy, I build, I keep them on display, I know all the sites to get after market sets, but I always have a hard time keeping what I have, what I want, and which I'll get next in order. So I decided to make a personal Lego inventory tracker as this app, where a user can see available sets from the database I've curated, find something specific, and save it on a list of their choice, leaving reviews on sets along the way! The database will continue to grow and grow.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Material UI
- Material UI documentation was very useful
- My own API, built using Django REST Framework

---

## Install Intructions

- Use the application by heading to the URL deployed on heroku - from there you'll be able to browse the extensive catalogue of Star Wars Legos (more to come, Harry Potter etc.), find what you like, make a list or two, and leave a review.
- OR do your own work to it and fork and clone this repo!
